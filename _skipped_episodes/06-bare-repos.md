title: (Optional) Non-bare and bare repositories
teaching: 10
exercises: 0
questions:
  - What are bare repositories?
  - How can we create a common repository for a group on our local computer or server?
keypoints:
  - We do programming work inside non-bare repositories.
  - We can create a local common repository where we can push to and pull from.

## Two types of repositories

### Non-bare repository

- A **non-bare repository** contains `.git/` as well as a snapshot of your tracked files that you can directly edit called **the working tree** (the actual files you can edit).
- **This is where we edit and commit changes**.

### Bare repository

- A **bare repository** contains only the `.git/` part, no files you can directly edit.
- By convention the names of bare repositories end with `.git` to emphasize this.
- We never do actual editing work inside a bare repository.
- GitHub, GitLab, etc. store a bare repository.
- You can also create a bare repository on your computer/server to store your private repository.

If we have enough time, the instructor demonstrates how to create a bare repository on the local computer:

- Create a new local repository with `git init`.
- Populate it with a file and a commit or two.
- Create one or two branches.
- Clone this repository on the same computer with either `--bare` or `--mirror`:

```shell
$ cd /path/to/example
$ git init

# now add some commits and branches ...

$ git clone --bare /path/to/example /path/to/example-bare
```

- Inspect the bare repository.
- Clone the bare repository:

```shell
$ git clone /path/to/example-bare /path/to/example-clone
$ cd /path/to/example-clone
```

- Inside the clone inspect `git remote -v`.
- Inside the clone create a commit and push the commit to `origin`.
- The bare repository can be cloned several times and one can exercise pushing and pulling changes.
